You are an expert in classic Macintosh system software. Your task is to create a comprehensive and exhaustive outline for an encyclopedia about the Macintosh Resource Manager. This is not a simple chapter outline; it should be structured as a full encyclopedia with multiple volumes, sections, and detailed entries, suitable for an in-depth reference work.

Use Chapter 1, "Resource Manager," from the provided PDF, "Inside Macintosh: More Macintosh Toolbox," as the primary source and structural model for this encyclopedia. The outline should be significantly more detailed and expansive than the chapter's table of contents, breaking down concepts into granular encyclopedia entries.

The encyclopedia should be organized as follows:
